# fake-news-extension

The following project runs a series of models on the dataset of [fake/real news](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) to identify the best fit model for detecting fake news. The best fit model will be imported into the chrome extension to identify fake or real articles on the chrome browser. 

Chrome extension boilerplate code: https://github.com/EmailThis/extension-boilerplate 

** take note that the dataset cannot be contained in this repository due to large file size


### Sequence of project

* data_analysis.ipynb
* data_processing.ipynb
* models.ipynb (runs through series of model training)
* LR_classifier.ipynb (export model as jolib file for extension)

### How it works
* the extension runs on a flask server that handles requests
* the extension retrieves the article's title through html tags, and sends it to the flask server
* the classifier imported into the server is then run on the news title
* prediction will be sent upon clicking the 'predict' button of the extension

### How to run the project
* unpack the chrome folder stored in the project in developer mode of the chrome browser
* go to root directory of project in terminal and run the following:
* python server.py

Take note that the classifier model.pkl has already been exported, hence the project is ready to run without going through the jupyter notebooks.
